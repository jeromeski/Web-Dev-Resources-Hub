In React, the lifecycle of a component refers to the sequence of events that occur from the moment the component is mounted to the time it is unmounted. When you use inline functions in a component without `useEffect` or `useCallback`, these functions are indeed recreated on every render.

Here's a breakdown of the lifecycle phases for a functional component with inline functions:

1. **Mounting Phase**: This is when the component is being created and inserted into the DOM. If you define an inline function within the component, it will be created during this phase.

2. **Rendering Phase**: Each time the component's state or props change, the component re-renders. During this phase, all inline functions defined within the component are recreated. This is because functions in JavaScript are objects, and defining a function within the render method (or the body of a functional component) creates a new instance of the function object each time.

3. **Updating Phase**: If the parent component of the component with inline functions re-renders, the child component will also re-render by default, leading to the recreation of the inline functions unless `React.memo` or `shouldComponentUpdate` is used to prevent it.

4. **Unmounting Phase**: When the component is removed from the DOM, the inline functions go out of scope and are garbage collected, assuming there are no remaining references to them elsewhere in your application.

The recreation of inline functions on each render can potentially lead to performance issues, especially if these functions are passed as props to child components that are pure or are using `React.memo`. The child components would re-render unnecessarily because they would receive 'new' props each time the parent renders.

To prevent this, you can use the `useCallback` hook to memoize the inline functions so that they maintain the same reference across renders, provided that their dependencies haven't changed. This can help to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders¹²³⁴.
