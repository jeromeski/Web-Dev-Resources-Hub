The `useCallback` hook in React is a powerful tool for optimizing performance, but it can be overkill in certain situations. Here are some real-world examples where using `useCallback` might be unnecessary:

1. **Simple Functions in Leaf Components**: If you have a simple function that doesn't cause expensive computations and is used in a leaf component (a component at the end of the component tree with no children), memoizing it with `useCallback` is likely overkill.

2. **Functions in Components That Don't Re-render Often**: If your component doesn't re-render often or doesn't pass the functions down as props to children, wrapping functions in `useCallback` won't have a significant impact on performance.

3. **Non-Prop Functions**: Functions that aren't passed as props and are only used within the same component don't need to be memoized, as they don't trigger re-renders of child components.

4. **Static Functions**: If a function doesn't depend on props or state and can be defined outside of the component, it doesn't need to be wrapped in `useCallback`, because it won't be recreated on each render.

5. **Premature Optimization**: Using `useCallback` everywhere without profiling your app first can lead to premature optimization. It's better to identify bottlenecks using performance tools and then decide if `useCallback` is necessary.

6. **State Setter Functions From useState**: The setter functions returned from the `useState` hook are stable and don't change between renders. Wrapping these in `useCallback` is redundant.

7. **Event Handlers in Non-Memoized Components**: If you're passing event handlers to components that aren't memoized and don't rely on referential equality, using `useCallback` is unnecessary.

8. **Over-Memoization**: Overusing `useCallback` can lead to more memory consumption, as each memoized function takes up space. This can potentially slow down your app instead of speeding it up.

In summary, `useCallback` should be used when a function is passed as a prop to a child component that relies on referential equality to prevent unnecessary re-renders, or when a function is included in the dependency array of `useEffect` or another hook that runs based on reference equality. Otherwise, it might be overkill and could even lead to worse performance due to increased memory usage¹²⁴.
