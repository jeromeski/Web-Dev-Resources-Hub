When working with `localStorage` in React, it's a common practice to use hooks to manage the state and side effects related to `localStorage`. However, since hooks cannot be called inside loops, conditions, or nested functions, you'll need to structure your code accordingly.

Here are some recommendations:

1. **Custom Hook**: Create a custom hook that encapsulates the `localStorage` logic. This hook can provide functions to set and get items from `localStorage`, and it can internally manage any state or effects.

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
    try {
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
      return initialValue;
    }
  });

  const setValue = value => {
    try {
      const valueToStore = value instanceof Function ? value(storedValue) : value;
      setStoredValue(valueToStore);
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(valueToStore));
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  };

  return [storedValue, setValue];
}
```

2. **Effect Hook**: Use the `useEffect` hook to synchronize the state with `localStorage`. This way, any changes to the state within your component will automatically update `localStorage`.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('myKey', JSON.stringify(myState));
}, [myState]);
```

3. **State Management**: Manage the state outside of the inline function. You can define state and handlers at the component level and pass them down to your inline function as needed.

4. **Event Handlers**: Instead of inline functions, define your event handlers outside of the JSX and reference them inside. This will make it easier to use hooks and manage state.

By following these practices, you can effectively use `localStorage` within your React components while adhering to the rules of hooks. Remember to handle exceptions and consider the synchronous nature of `localStorage` when designing your state management strategy.
