Sure, here are some core layout components that you might typically find in a React application:

1. **Container**: This is a component that may contain any part of the application and has a specific width to its contents.

2. **Grid**: This component allows you to create grid layouts in your application. It's often used in combination with the Row and Column components.

3. **Row**: This component represents a horizontal row in your grid system.

4. **Column**: This component represents a vertical column in your grid system.

5. **Header**: This component is usually at the top of your application and contains things like the application logo, navigation links, and possibly some user controls.

6. **Footer**: This component is usually at the bottom of your application and might contain information like copyright notices, links to terms of service, etc.

7. **Sidebar/Navigation Drawer**: This component is typically used for housing a navigation menu and other UI elements that need to be accessible from anywhere in the application.

8. **Main**: This component is where the primary content of your application goes. It often changes based on the current route.

9. **Card**: This component is a flexible and extensible content container that includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, and powerful display options.

10. **Modal/Dialog**: This component is used to overlay smaller pieces of content over the main ones, typically used for prompts, confirmations, or additional information forms.

11. **Tabs**: This component is used to switch between different views within the same context.

12. **Accordion/Collapse**: These components allow you to toggle the visibility of sections of content.

Remember, these are just examples and the specific components you use will depend on the needs of your application. Many of these components are available in UI libraries like Material-UI, Ant Design, and Bootstrap, but you can also create your own custom components. ðŸ˜Š
