Sure, in a typical React application, you might find a variety of core components. Here are some examples:

1. **App**: This is usually the root component of your application. It often contains the routing logic and global state providers.

2. **Layout**: These components are responsible for the overall layout of the page, such as headers, footers, and sidebars.

3. **Page**: These components represent individual pages in your application. They usually correspond to different routes.

4. **Form**: These components handle user input, validation, and form submission.

5. **Input**: These are reusable components for different types of input fields, such as text, select, radio, checkbox, etc.

6. **Button**: A reusable component for different types of buttons.

7. **Card**: A common UI element used to display grouped information in a flexible-size container.

8. **Modal**: A component that displays content in a layer above the app.

9. **List**: A component that renders a list of items.

10. **ListItem**: A component that represents a single item in a list.

11. **Table**: A component for displaying tabular data.

12. **Loader/Spinner**: These components give visual feedback when content is loading.

13. **ErrorBoundary**: A component used to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI.

14. **AuthProvider**: In applications that require authentication, this component usually provides authentication-related functions and state to the rest of the app.

Remember, the exact components and their names can vary greatly depending on the specific needs of your application. The above is just a general example and your application might have different, more specific components. ðŸ˜Š
