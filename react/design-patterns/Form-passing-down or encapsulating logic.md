The best practice can depend on the specific needs of your project and the complexity of your form. Here are two common approaches:

1. **Passing Props Down**: If your LoginForm component is used in multiple places with different behaviors, it might be beneficial to pass props down. This makes the component more reusable and its behavior more customizable from the parent component.

2. **Encapsulating Logic**: If the LoginForm is unique and not reused, or if it has complex logic that doesn't need to be known by the parent component, encapsulating all the logic inside the LoginForm can make the parent component cleaner and easier to maintain.

In general, it's a balance between reusability and simplicity. If you find yourself passing too many props and making the parent component complex, it might be a sign that the LoginForm should handle more of its own logic. Conversely, if the LoginForm becomes too complex, it might be a sign that some of its state or logic could be lifted to the parent component. It's always a good idea to discuss these architectural decisions with your team to find the best approach for your specific project. Remember, the key is to keep components manageable, understandable, and as decoupled as possible.
