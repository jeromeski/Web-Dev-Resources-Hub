Sure, here are some common directory structures used in React applications:

1. **Feature Folders**: This structure organizes files by feature. Each feature has its own folder, which contains all the components, tests, styles, and any other files related to that feature. This is the structure you shared earlier.

2. **Grouping by File Type**: In this structure, files are grouped by their type. For example, all components are in a `components` folder, all tests are in a `tests` folder, and so on. This can be useful for small projects, but it can become difficult to manage as the project grows.

3. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: This structure organizes files based on the domain concept they relate to. For example, all files related to user management might be in a `user` folder.

4. **Atomic Design**: This structure organizes components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages based on their complexity and reusability. It's a methodology developed by Brad Frost.

5. **Ducks**: This is a Redux-specific pattern where actions, action types, and reducers are bundled together in the same file or folder.

6. **Fractal**: In this structure, components are organized in a way that mirrors the way they are composed in the application. If component `A` uses component `B`, then the files for `B` would be located in a subdirectory of `A`.

Remember, the best structure for a project depends on its size, complexity, and the team's preferences. It's important to choose a structure that makes the codebase easy to understand and maintain.

Absolutely, here are some alternative names for Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms in the context of Atomic Design:
