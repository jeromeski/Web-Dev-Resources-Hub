In Next.js, `pageProps` is an object that contains the initial props for a page. These initial props are populated by Next.js during its server-side rendering or static site generation processes, and they can also be manually populated by exporting an async function called `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` from your page.

Here's a brief overview of what `pageProps` might contain:

- **Data Fetching**: If you're fetching data in `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`, the fetched data should be returned as an object from these functions. This object will be merged into `pageProps`.

- **Query Parameters**: If your page has dynamic routes, `pageProps` will contain a `query` object with the dynamic route parameters.

- **Custom Props**: You can add custom props to `pageProps` in `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`. These custom props will then be accessible in your page component.

In your `_app.tsx` file, `pageProps` is being passed as props to the `Component` (which represents the current page). So, any data you add to `pageProps` in `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` will be accessible as props in your page components. 

Remember, the structure of `pageProps` will depend on what you return from `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` in your page files. It's a flexible feature of Next.js that allows you to efficiently manage and pass server-side data to your pages. ðŸ˜Š
