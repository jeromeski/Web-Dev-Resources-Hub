Sure, here's how you can annotate a `fetch` API call with `try` and `catch` in TypeScript:

```typescript
interface ResponseData {
  // Define the shape of your response data here
}

async function fetchData(url: string): Promise<ResponseData> {
  try {
    const response: Response = await fetch(url);

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const data: ResponseData = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation: ', error.message);
    throw error; // Re-throw the error if you want to handle it further up the call stack
  }
}
```

In this example, `ResponseData` is a TypeScript interface that describes the shape of the data your API returns. You should replace it with the actual shape of your data.

`Response` is a built-in TypeScript interface that describes the shape of a Fetch API response.

Remember, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so you'll need a TypeScript compiler to convert your TypeScript code back into JavaScript. If you're not already using TypeScript in your project, you might need to set it up. Let me know if you need help with that! ðŸ˜Š
