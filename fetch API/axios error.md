The `AxiosError` object is thrown when Axios encounters an error during a request. It contains several properties that provide information about the error³. Here's the structure of an `AxiosError` object:

```typescript
{
  // `message` is the error message text
  message: string,

  // `response` is the response object (if received)
  response: {
    // `data` is the response that was provided by the server
    data: any,

    // `status` is the HTTP status code from the server response
    status: number,

    // `headers` are the HTTP headers that the server responded with
    headers: any,
    
    // Other properties...
  },

  // `config` is the config that was provided to `axios` for the request
  config: any,

  // Other properties...
}
```

In the `response` object inside the `AxiosError`, you will find the `data`, `status`, and `headers` objects⁴. The `data` property contains the response from the server, the `status` property contains the HTTP status code, and the `headers` property contains the HTTP headers that the server responded with².

You can handle these errors using the `catch` block in your promise chain. The error object will be available in the `catch` block¹. For example:

```typescript
axios.get('/api/xyz/abcd')
  .catch(function (error) {
    if (error.response) {
      console.log(error.response.data);
      console.log(error.response.status);
      console.log(error.response.headers);
    }
  });
```

In this code, we're checking if the `response` property exists on the `error` object. If it does, we know that the server responded with an error, and we can log the `data`, `status`, and `headers` properties to understand more about what went wrong¹.
