Tracing the code flow in a Next.js application from the moment a URL is entered to when the login page is displayed involves understanding the lifecycle of a Next.js page. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you might follow:

1. **Server-side**: When a URL is entered, Next.js first executes code on the server. This includes the `getServerSideProps` or `getInitialProps` functions if they are defined in your page.
2. **Routing**: Next.js then resolves the URL to the appropriate page in the `pages` directory.
3. **Rendering**: The React components for the page are rendered. If you're using a loader, it might be part of your `_app.js` or a specific component that wraps your page content.
4. **Client-side Hydration**: Once the server-rendered page reaches the client, React "hydrates" the page to make it interactive.

To start debugging, you can place breakpoints in the following areas:
- **`getServerSideProps` or `getInitialProps`**: If you have server-side data fetching.
- **Page Component**: The main export of the page you're navigating to, often at the beginning of the function or class component.
- **Custom App (`_app.js`)**: If you have a custom App component, you can place a breakpoint at the beginning of this file to see when the page components start rendering.
- **Loader Component**: If you have a specific loader component, place a breakpoint at its invocation or inside its render method.

Since you're interested in the loader and the login page, you might want to start with breakpoints in the custom App component (`_app.js`) and the login page component itself. This will allow you to step through the rendering process and see how the application state changes leading up to the display of the login page.

Remember, if you're using functional components with hooks, you can also use the React DevTools to inspect the hooks and their state at different points in time.

For a more detailed understanding of the authentication flow in Next.js, you can refer to the [Next.js documentation on authentication](^1^) and [tutorials](^2^) that explain the process step by step. These resources can provide insights into where to place breakpoints for observing the authentication and page loading sequence.
