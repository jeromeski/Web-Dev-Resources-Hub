Sure, here are some steps you can follow to improve the performance of your Next.js application with MUI, Emotion, and Context:
- MUI Integration with Next.js App Router1:
    - Install the dependencies: @mui/material and next.
    - Import the AppRouterCacheProvider from @mui/material-nextjs/v13-appRouter and wrap all elements under the <body> with it. This component is responsible for collecting the CSS generated by MUI System on the server1.
    - Optionally, you can use the options prop to override the default cache options1.
    - Create a custom theme that includes the 'use client' directive and pass the theme to ThemeProvider1.
- Setting Up MUI with NextJS, Emotion, and Typescript2:
    - Create a new NextJS project with Typescript.
    - Install MUI and Emotion into your project.
    - Create an isomorphic emotion cache that works for both client and server2.
- Optimizing React Components and Reducing Render Times5:
    - Manage state efficiently with React Hooks and Context API5.
- Leverage Built-in Optimizations in Next.js4:
    - Next.js comes with a variety of built-in optimizations designed to improve your application's speed and Core Web Vitals4.
Remember, performance optimization is an iterative process and involves profiling and measuring the performance of your application, identifying bottlenecks, and applying optimizations. Always test the impact of your changes to ensure they're having the desired effect. Happy coding! ðŸš€
