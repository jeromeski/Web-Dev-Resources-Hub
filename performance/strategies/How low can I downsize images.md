When downsizing an image for web use, the goal is to balance quality with file size to ensure fast loading times without compromising the visual integrity of the image. Here's a general guideline:

- **Pixel width**: For full-screen backgrounds, **2500 pixels** wide is usually sufficient².
- **File size**: Aim for a file size between **50KB to 150KB** for standard website images³. For more impactful images like hero images, you can go up to **500KB**⁴.

Remember, these are general recommendations and the optimal size may vary depending on the specific use case and the audience's device capabilities. It's also important to consider the dimensions and aspect ratio to ensure the image displays correctly across different devices².

For the best user experience, especially on mobile devices, you should aim for the smallest file size that still provides an acceptable level of quality. Tools like image compressors can help reduce file size without noticeably affecting image quality. Additionally, using modern image formats like WebP can offer better compression and quality characteristics compared to traditional formats like PNG and JPEG.
