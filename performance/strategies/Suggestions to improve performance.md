Here are some suggestions to improve the performance and speed of your Next.js code:

1. **Server Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js supports Server Side Rendering, which can significantly improve the performance of your application. You can use `getServerSideProps` to fetch data on each request.

2. **Static Generation (SG)**: If your page content can be generated at build time, consider using Static Generation with `getStaticProps`. This can provide performance benefits over Server Side Rendering.

3. **Data Fetching**: Instead of fetching data in `useEffect`, consider using Next.js data fetching methods like `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, or `getInitialProps`. These methods fetch data before rendering the page, which can improve performance.

4. **Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically supports code splitting, ensuring only necessary code is loaded for each page. Make sure you're taking advantage of this by avoiding large bundles of code in a single file.

5. **Optimize Images**: If you're using images, consider using the Next.js Image component, which optimizes images for different screen sizes and supports lazy loading.

6. **Avoid Inline Functions**: Inline functions can cause unnecessary re-renders. Consider moving function definitions outside of your components or use `useCallback` hook.

7. **State Management**: If you're using a lot of state, consider using a state management library like Redux or MobX, or the built-in `useReducer` hook for complex state logic.

8. **API Calls**: For API calls, consider using SWR (stale-while-revalidate) or React Query. These libraries allow efficient fetching, caching, and state updates for server data.

Remember, it's important to measure performance with tools like Google Lighthouse or WebPageTest before and after making these changes to ensure they're having a positive impact. 

Here's how you can apply some of these suggestions:

```jsx
// Use getServerSideProps for data fetching
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const prospects = await Api.getProspects();
  const companyInfo = await Api.getCompanyInfo();
  // ...fetch other necessary data

  return {
    props: {
      initialProspects: prospects,
      initialCompanyInfo: companyInfo,
      // ...other data
    },
  };
}

const EcommerceDashboard = ({ initialProspects, initialCompanyInfo }) => {
  const [prospects, setProspects] = useState(initialProspects);
  const [companyInfo, setCompanyInfo] = useState(initialCompanyInfo);
  // ...rest of your component
};
```

This is just a basic example. Depending on your application's needs, you might need to adjust this code. For example, if your data changes frequently, you might want to use Client-side Rendering with SWR or React Query instead of `getServerSideProps`. If your page doesn't need to be pre-rendered, you might want to fetch data on the client side in `useEffect`.
