Sure, I can suggest a few improvements to your code. Here are my suggestions:

1. **Use TypeScript**: It seems like you're using TypeScript, but there are some places where you're using `any` as a type. It's generally a good practice to avoid using `any` and instead create interfaces or types that describe the shape of your data. This can help catch errors at compile time.

2. **Error Handling**: In your async functions, you're catching errors but only logging them to the console. It might be helpful to set an error state and display a message to the user when an error occurs.

3. **Code Duplication**: There's some duplicated code in your `useEffect` hooks where you're getting items from local storage and setting state. You could create a custom hook to handle this.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: Your component is doing a lot of things - fetching data, handling OTP validation, managing several pieces of state, and rendering UI. Consider breaking it up into smaller components or custom hooks. This will make your code more modular, easier to understand, and easier to test.

5. **Magic Numbers**: You're using magic numbers in your code (like `setCurrentTab(1)`). It would be better to use named constants for these to make your code more readable and maintainable.

6. **Dependency Array in useEffect**: In some of your `useEffect` hooks, you're passing an empty dependency array, which means the effect will only run once after the initial render. If there are values that your effect depends on, they should be included in the dependency array.

Here are the principles I used in these suggestions:
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: This principle is aimed at reducing repetition. Don't write the same code in multiple places.
- **Separation of Concerns**: This principle suggests that each section of your code should have responsibility over a single aspect of the functionality.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: This principle states that a function, module, or class should have one, and only one, reason to change. This is similar to separation of concerns but at a lower level.
- **Fail Fast**: This principle encourages you to report any error condition as soon as possible and stop execution rather than trying to proceed in a potentially inconsistent state.
- **Use Intention-Revealing Names**: The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used.
