To target the second adjacent `.MuiBox-root` element, you can use the `:nth-of-type` pseudo-class selector in combination with the adjacent sibling combinator (`+`). However, CSS alone does not provide a straightforward way to select the "second next" sibling.

Here's an example of how you might do it:

```css
'& .MuiBox-root' : {
  /* Your styles here */
  '& + .MuiBox-root + .MuiBox-root' : {
    /* Styles for the second adjacent .MuiBox-root */
    marginBottom: 6
  }
}
```

In this code, `'& + .MuiBox-root + .MuiBox-root'` will select any `.MuiBox-root` that is immediately following another `.MuiBox-root` which itself is immediately following another `.MuiBox-root`.

However, please note that this will apply the style to every `.MuiBox-root` that is the second sibling, not just the second one in the entire document. If you need more complex selection logic, you might need to use JavaScript or a JavaScript-based library like jQuery.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. ðŸ˜Š
