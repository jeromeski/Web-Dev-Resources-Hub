### Example URL Using Multiple Metrics
If you want to fetch several metrics for a post, you can combine them in the `_metrics` variable. For example, if `postId` is `1234567890` and you want to fetch `post_engaged_users`, `post_clicks`, `post_impressions`, and `post_reactions_like_total`, the constructed URL would be:

```plaintext
https://graph.facebook.com/v19.0/1234567890?fields=insights.metric(post_engaged_users,post_clicks,post_impressions,post_reactions_like_total)
```

This URL will fetch the engaged users, total clicks, total impressions, and total "Like" reactions for the post with ID `1234567890`.

By using these metrics, you can gain comprehensive insights into how users are interacting with your Facebook posts, which can help you understand the performance and effectiveness of your content.
