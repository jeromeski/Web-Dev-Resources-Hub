To perfectly center an image within a div using CSS with absolute positioning and transitions, you can follow these steps:

1. Set the parent div to a relative position. This will serve as the reference point for the absolutely positioned image.
2. Apply absolute positioning to the image.
3. Set the `top` and `left` properties to `50%` to move the image to the center of the div.
4. Use the `transform` property with `translate(-50%, -50%)` to offset the image back by half its height and width, ensuring it's centered regardless of its size.
5. Add a transition property for a smooth effect when the image position changes.

Here's an example of the CSS code:

```css
.parent-div {
  position: relative;
  /* Other styles */
}

.centered-image {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  transition: all 0.5s ease; /* Adjust time and easing function as needed */
}
```

In this setup, the `.centered-image` class is applied to your image, and it will be perfectly centered inside the `.parent-div`. The transition will create a smooth effect for any changes in the position or size of the image.
